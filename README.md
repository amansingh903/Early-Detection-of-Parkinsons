# 🧠 ML Classification Project

This repository contains a comparative study of several machine learning models for a classification task. Our goal was to evaluate model performance and identify the most effective classifiers for the dataset provided.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project explores and compares various machine learning classifiers including:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) / Neural Network**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**

Each model is trained, evaluated, and visualized through confusion matrices and accuracy scores.

---

## 📊 Results Summary

- ✅ **Neural Network (MLP)** and **SVM** achieved the **highest accuracy** across multiple runs.
- 📉 Performance of other models was slightly lower but competitive depending on hyperparameters and feature selection.
- 📌 Confusion matrices for **each classifier** are provided in the Jupyter notebook for visual comparison of predictions.

## ⚙️ Customization Guide

You can tailor this project to your own dataset or experiment setup.

### 🔧 1. Add/Remove Features

Modify the feature list in the notebook to include only the relevant columns:

```python
features = ['feature_1', 'feature_2', 'feature_3']  # Edit this list as needed
```

### 📈 2. Try More Models

Add your own classifiers to the dictionary:

```python
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB

classifiers = {
    "SVM": SVC(),
    "Neural Network": MLPClassifier(),
    "Naive Bayes": GaussianNB(),  # Example addition
}
```

### 🧪 3. Hyperparameter Tuning

Use tools like `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to find optimal parameters:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10]}
grid = GridSearchCV(SVC(), param_grid, cv=5)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 🧠 4. Use Ensemble Methods

Combine multiple models for stronger performance:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier

ensemble = VotingClassifier(estimators=[
    ('svm', SVC(probability=True)),
    ('mlp', MLPClassifier())
], voting='soft')

ensemble.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
